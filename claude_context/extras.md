- in an existing place with image/images, when attempting to edit the place the image miniatures dont display, adding a new image seems to replace an existing image (if theres 2 images and you click edit and add +1 image and save, youll have 1 old and 1 new image, the second old gets replaced). deleting all the images and adding new ones works fine

- scrolling down the page, the 'Avaliações' box remains static but the 'Informações de Contato' box scrolls down, getting behind the 'Avaliações' box. could we make both static?

- id like for the col-lg-8 to stretch bigger, the placement of the boxes is good (col-lg-8 in the left, col-lg-4 on the right) but to help readability, col-lg-8 should extend horizontally more. we might need to change the way we defined the placement (perhaps move away from col-lg if it makes the positioning easier)

- if the place isnt aproved yet, as in, were seeing the 'preview'/ 'details' from admin of the place, there should be a big indicator that its a preview to diferentiate from the actual place, maybe a red line arround it or a tag somewhere

in: landing

-clicking the preview image on the block for a place should also lead you to its page, not only the ver detalhes button (specifically card-img-top place-card-img)

- lets add a fade-in for the site when loading to the landing page, it can be slightly slow to look polished

- on the landing-map, is there any way we could, maybe, display on the map the places on the site with pins? im unsure how much we can do with the google maps api, but, lets say we have an entry with street 2 on the site, then the map could show a pin wherever that street 2 is, and clicking on the pin would lead you to the details page of that place
